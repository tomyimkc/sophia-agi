# Failure Ledger

Failures are claim evidence. They show where the system is not AGI.

| Failure ID | Status | Claim impact | Required response |
|---|---|---|---|
| external-benchmarks-not-run | Open | Blocks expert AGI claim | Keep wording at AGI-candidate |
| hidden-review-third-party-not-run | Open | Blocks independent hidden generalization claim | Run third-party packs |
| hidden-prepared-pack-grok-cli-2026-06-19 | Open | Preliminary hidden run only: 28.75/40 auto score, 2/8 strict pass | Improve strict pass rate; run fresh third-party hidden pack |
| hidden-fresh-pack-sophia-grok-2026-06-19 | Open | Full hidden-run artifact exists, but backend produced 0/8 nonempty answers; not valid evidence of reasoning competence | Fix Grok/session/network execution and run a new unspent hidden pack |
| hidden-fresh-pack-sophia-deepseek-2026-06-19 | Open | Diagnostic spent-pack run reached 27.5/40 auto score, 8/8 nonempty answers, and 0 backend failures, but 0/8 strict pass; not independent proof evidence | Complete manual semantic review, improve missed rubric/coding/tool-use behavior, then run a new unspent reviewer-controlled pack |
| hidden-fresh-pack-sophia-deepseek-coding-council-repair3-2026-06-20 | Open | Diagnostic spent-pack rerun improved to 31.9/40 auto score with 8/8 nonempty answers; strict pass remains 0/8 because manual semantic review is still pending and tool-use dropped to 50% | Complete two-pass manual review, strengthen tool-use log-grounding prompts, then run a new unspent reviewer-controlled pack |
| hidden-full-sophia-valid-run-not-yet-run | Open | Blocks claim that the full Sophia pipeline beats direct-model answering on hidden tasks | Run `tools/run_hidden_eval_sophia.py` on an unspent reviewer-controlled pack with working backend |
| hidden-manual-review-not-complete | Open | Blocks semantic-quality claims from automatic keyword/regex scoring alone | Complete manual judge review templates |
| baseline-ablation-missing | Open | Blocks method-value claim | Run raw/ablated comparisons |
| long-horizon-not-run | Open | Blocks autonomy claim | Publish timed run logs |
| distribution-shift-not-run | Open | Blocks learning claim | Run pre/post append-only experiment |
| rlvr-live-run-not-yet-gated-2026-06-21 | Open | Blocks RLVR capability claim (held-out pass@1 rise vs base) | Run a gated live GRPO run clearing `aggregate._is_validated` (≥2 judge families, κ≥0.40, ≥3 runs, CI excludes 0) on an entity-disjoint held-out split + manual semantic review; offline reward-wiring invariants pass in CI but are not capability evidence |
| local-agent-tools-degrade-strong-model-2026-06-21 | Closed | FIXED: selective invocation (tools fire only on low-confidence answers) + richer tool outputs (wiki_search snippets, belief wiki fallback) eliminated the degradation — on qwen3:30b-a3b `+mcp-tools` now *beats* alone (gold 90.2%→92.7%, false-positive 9.8%→7.3%), was 90.2%→51.2% before | — |
| local-agent-delta-strong-model-headroom-2026-06-21 | Superseded | Single-LEXICAL-judge run on dolphin-llama3:8b showed alone 15.2% → +gate 4.3%. This did NOT survive validation — see below. `+mcp-tools` 0.0% was re-generation, NOT tool-use (`toolsUsed: []`). | Superseded by `local-agent-delta-not-validated-2026-06-21` |
| local-agent-delta-not-validated-2026-06-21 | Open | The dolphin gate delta does NOT clear the no-overclaim gate. Validated run (3 runs, 2 judge families = ollama:llama3.2:3b + deepseek:deepseek-chat): halluc alone 9.4% → gated 7.2%, Δ2.2%, **95% CI [−2.2%, +6.5%] includes zero** → `validated=False`. Robust: false-positive cost 0.0%, coverage 46.2%, judge-agreement 78%. Confirms RESULTS.md "judge choice dominates the absolute number": the single-lexical-judge 15.2%→4.3% over-counted. NO quotable capability number. | Increase N (more false cases / more runs) to tighten the CI off zero; only the 0%-FP-cost and coverage figures are quotable today |
