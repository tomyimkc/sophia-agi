# Changelog

All notable changes to Sophia AGI are documented here.

## [0.7.14] - 2026-06-21

### Added — M2 v1: out-of-prompt data-flow firewall (capability + taint)

Moves the security boundary into deterministic code (CaMeL principle): the model
can be fully compromised, but it cannot drive untrusted data into a side-effecting
sink. See `docs/11-Platform/Security-Roadmap.md`.

- **`agent/dataflow/`** — dependency-free enforcement core: taint labels
  (`untrusted`/`trusted`, propagated via `combine`); per-tool capabilities
  (`READ`/`WRITE`/`EGRESS`) with a default-deny manifest for the real `sophia_*`
  tools; a deterministic policy (`decide`) and `firewalled()` wrapper that **blocks
  the lethal trifecta** (tainted → write/egress sink) or routes it to human
  approval, and an **airgap** profile that fail-closes all egress.
- **Live airgap wiring**: `openclaw_infer` and online `web_evidence_search` return
  a blocked result under `SOPHIA_PROFILE=airgap` (no behavior change otherwise).
- **Red-team scores the firewall** (`eval/security/`): lethal-trifecta **ASR 0%**
  (exfil-via-egress, write-poisoning, airgap-egress, unknown-sink; baseline 100%),
  reads not over-blocked — two new gating invariants.
- Tests: `tests/test_dataflow.py` (taint propagation, policy matrix, lethal-trifecta
  block, HITL path, default-deny unknown tool, live airgap); wired into CI.
- **Honest scope:** this is the enforcement boundary. The dual-LLM privileged-
  planner / quarantined-extractor split + constrained-AST interpreter is M2.2.

## [0.7.13] - 2026-06-21

### Fixed — negation-evasion in the provenance gate (red-team finding)

The M1 red-team found a real exploit in `agent/verifiers.py:provenance_faithful`:
the negation/correction carve-out was **sentence-scoped**, so a trigger word in
one clause ("it is a myth, but in truth Confucius wrote the Dao De Jing";
"contrary to the claim that he did not, …") shielded an asserting clause in the
same sentence (100% ASR on those probes).

- **Fix:** the carve-out is now **clause-scoped** — `_carveout_clauses` splits a
  sentence on contrastive connectors (but/however/yet/in truth/actually/…) and a
  leading subordinate clause (contrary to/despite/although/…), but **not on commas**,
  so the appositive author→title matching the gate relies on is preserved. A
  correction only excuses the clause it lives in.
- **Locked in:** 4 negation-evasion variants are now **gating at 0% ASR** in the
  red-team; `test_verifiers.py` gains `test_provenance_negation_evasion_is_clause_scoped`
  (exploits caught, genuine corrections still pass). 0 false positives across the
  68 committed corpus/dispute pages (`lint_wiki_provenance`).
- Remaining red-team probe (open): citation subject-match → NLI fact-checking (roadmap M-#5).

## [0.7.12] - 2026-06-21

### Added — M1 injection / containment red-team + first confidentiality gate

The first security-roadmap milestone (`docs/11-Platform/Security-Roadmap.md`).

- **Injection red-team** (`eval/security/`, `tools/run_security_redteam.py`):
  deterministic, offline harness under an **assume-compromised-model** threat model
  — it measures whether the gate/policy verifiers (outside the model) contain an
  attacker-controlled LLM. Gating attacks contained at **0% ASR**: forbidden
  attribution, false arithmetic, topic-mismatch citation. Success judged by code,
  never by an LLM. CI-gated.
- **`no_secret_leak` verifier** (`agent/verifiers.py`) + **`confidentiality`
  policy** (`agent/policies.py`, with `secrets=` plumbed through `guarded_complete`):
  a deterministic verbatim-secret tripwire. Secret-exfiltration ASR **100%
  baseline → 0%** with it — the harness measured the hole and proved the fix.
- **Two real gaps the harness surfaced** (reported, drive later milestones):
  citation subject-match (lexical overlap passes a wrong predicate → motivates NLI
  fact-checking); and a **negation-evasion in `provenance_faithful`** — a carve-out
  trigger word in the same sentence as a forbidden attribution skips the
  sentence-scoped carve-out. The failing case is committed to drive the gate-hardening fix.
- Tests: `test_security_redteam.py` (gates containment, not the bug existence, so a
  future fix won't break it); wired into CI. Docs: `eval/security/README.md`.

## [0.7.11] - 2026-06-21

### Added — cross-entity generalization benchmark + first real external number

- **Cross-entity generalization** (`provenance_bench/cross_entity.py`,
  `tools/run_cross_entity.py`): makes the next frontier falsifiable on an
  **entity-disjoint** split (no author/work shared). Memorized rules score 100%
  on *seen* entities but **0% on unseen** (precise, zero FP, no transfer); a
  content-free structural detector scores **100% on unseen but 100% false-positive**
  (transfers, can't tell true from false). The honest conclusion: low-FP
  cross-entity generalization needs **external grounding**, not pattern
  memorization — which is why Sophia's answer is the retrieval-grounded loop. Six
  invariants gate CI; holds across seeds.
- **First real external-oracle number:** DeepSeek-chat on **GSM8K test, N=100 →
  98.0%** exact-match via `agent/external_eval.py`. Recorded in
  `published-results.json` / `RESULTS.md` with explicit framing: this validates the
  harness end-to-end and reports the **base model's** accuracy — it is **not** a
  claim about Sophia's gate. `tools/fetch_eval_dataset.py` produced the data
  (gitignored; not committed).
- Docs: `docs/11-Platform/Generality.md` gains the cross-entity section; tests
  `test_cross_entity.py` wired into CI.

## [0.7.10] - 2026-06-21

### Hardened — round-2 adversarial review (5 confirmed findings fixed)

A 18-agent adversarial review of the 0.7.9 surfaces confirmed 5 real defects
(9 rejected). All fixed, with regression tests:

- **Sandbox escape (HIGH)** — the model-proposer's `__` *substring* blocklist was
  bypassable by building a dunder at runtime (`"_"+"_"`) and traversing via
  `str.format` (reached `object`). Replaced with an **AST allowlist** in
  `agent/verifier_synthesis._compile_predicate`: no attribute access, imports,
  lambdas, loops, comprehensions, container literals, `*`/`**`, or non-allowlisted
  calls; minimal scalar builtins; 2 KB source cap. This also closes the two
  **MEDIUM** DoS findings (unbounded CPU via infinite loop; allocation bomb) —
  structurally, no subprocess/signal sandbox needed.
- **Gate must fail closed (HIGH)** — a custom/synthesised verifier that raised
  crashed `guarded_complete`. `_judge` now catches and returns `passed=False`
  (fail closed → repair/abstain), never propagates.
- **Honest abstention (LOW)** — removed the dead `Policy.abstention_passes` flag;
  the loop now re-judges the abstention and reports `action="abstained_unverified"`
  when it cannot clear its own gate (e.g. the code policy).
- **Latent bug found while fixing** — explicit `policy="provenance"` would have
  emitted an internal marker string as the abstention; provenance now uses its
  dynamic cited abstention whether selected by default or by name.
- `tools/sophia_guard.py` gained `--policy`; tests extended in
  `test_verifier_synthesis.py` (sandbox payloads) and `test_policies.py`
  (fail-closed, explicit-provenance, unverified-abstention).

## [0.7.9] - 2026-06-21

### Added — runtime policies, model-proposed checks, real-dataset eval, honest README

Makes the verifier-gated capabilities *usable at runtime* and follows through on
the standing recommendations.

- **Runtime verifier policies** (`agent/policies.py`, `agent/guarded.py`): the
  guarded loop's gate is now selectable per call or via `$SOPHIA_POLICY` —
  `provenance | citation | arithmetic | code`, or any custom/synthesised verifier
  via `verifier=`. Each policy carries its own repair hint + gate-passing
  abstention. The provenance default path is byte-for-byte unchanged.
- **Verifier-synthesis model proposer** (`agent/verifier_synthesis.py`):
  `propose_predicates` lets a model write candidate predicates (compiled under
  **restricted builtins** — no import/exec/eval/dunders) that clear the SAME
  meta-verification floor; a model only *widens* candidates, validation still
  confers trust. Gated by `$SOPHIA_ALLOW_PROPOSED_PREDICATES`.
- **External-eval real-dataset fetcher** (`tools/fetch_eval_dataset.py`):
  downloads + reshapes GSM8K to the eval's `{question, answer}` JSONL so the
  external-oracle harness yields a *citable* number. Conversion is a pure,
  unit-tested function; the network fetch is intentionally not run in CI.
- **Model-in-the-loop improvement** (`provenance_bench/improvement.py`,
  `tools/run_improvement_loop.py --model`): an injectable `answer_fn` sources
  TRAIN failures from a model. Fixed a correctness bug in the process: a rule is
  mined only when the text *actually asserts* the forbidden attribution (clean
  model text is no longer mis-mined as a failure). Deterministic path unchanged
  (held-out recall 17%→98%, 0% FP).
- **README reframed:** leads with verifier-gated provenance reasoning and a
  plain-scope statement; AGI is demoted to an explicitly *unmet* pre-registered
  threshold — the project's standing #1 review recommendation.
- Tests: `test_policies.py`, `test_fetch_eval_dataset.py`,
  `test_improvement_model_loop.py`, plus proposer cases — wired into CI.

## [0.7.8] - 2026-06-21

### Added — verifier synthesis (the bridge toward generality)

The verifier-gated loop is only as general as its verifiers, and you cannot
hand-write a verifier for a task you have never seen. This makes the loop write
and **trust-test its own checks** — and abstain when it cannot — without
overclaiming (see `docs/11-Platform/Verifier-Synthesis.md`).

- **Verifier synthesis** (`agent/verifier_synthesis.py`): a library of
  parameterised check templates is *fit* to a few oracle-labelled examples of a
  novel task to produce candidate verifiers; each candidate is **meta-verified**
  (precision + recall on a disjoint, independently-labelled validation split)
  before admission; admitted checks compose into a gate that drops into the
  harness via `as_verifier`. If nothing clears the floor, it **abstains**.
- **Calibrated abstention** (`agent/calibration.py`): competence where no verifier
  exists — ECE, risk–coverage, selective risk, and label-free self-consistency
  confidence. Falsifiable claim: selective risk < base risk ("knows what it
  doesn't know"). Demonstrated on a seeded **toy** noisy solver (illustrative, not
  a capability claim): selective risk 0.30 vs base 0.56 (ECE 0.15), the
  correlation emergent from the solver, not baked into the data.
- **Falsifiable ablation** (`agent/synthesis_eval.py`,
  `tools/run_verifier_synthesis.py`): deterministic suite of in-library vs
  out-of-library tasks, the latter with **length-matched decoys** so no template
  can separate them on any split. WITH meta-verification: in-library precision
  1.00 / recall 1.00 (0 abstentions), abstains on 100% of unverifiable tasks every
  seed. WITHOUT: false-admission 100% on unverifiable tasks and in-library
  precision degrades to 0.86 — proving the *meta-verification*, not the template
  library, earns the trust. Nine invariants gate CI (incl. a "no good-looking
  wrong gate" guard so a false admission can't hide behind an abstention count).
- **Honest scope:** not AGI, not unbounded synthesis — a finite library plus a
  trust contract; tasks that don't reduce to a checkable predicate stay out of
  reach, where calibrated abstention is the correct behaviour.
- Tests: `test_verifier_synthesis.py`, `test_calibration.py` — wired into CI.

## [0.7.7] - 2026-06-21

### Added — generality track (verifier-gated reasoning, measured honestly)

Extends the core verifier-gated loop beyond provenance, each piece with a
falsifiable metric and an honest scope label (see
`docs/11-Platform/Generality.md`). None of this licenses the word "AGI".

- **More machine-checked verifiers** (`agent/verifiers.py`): `citation_faithful`
  (RAG support check), `code_tests_pass` (extracts + **executes** answer code,
  exec-gated), `arithmetic_sound` (recomputes stated equalities); a `VERIFIERS`
  registry + `check_text`. Honest: more verifier *kinds* is engineering reuse,
  not a generality claim.
- **Measured self-improvement loop** (`provenance_bench/improvement.py`,
  `tools/run_improvement_loop.py`): learns rules from TRAIN failures, scored on a
  **disjoint-phrasing** held-out split (no contamination). First run: held-out
  recall 17% → 98% over 6 cycles, monotone, 0% false-positive cost — falsifiable.
- **Long-horizon autonomy curve** (`agent/horizon.py`,
  `tools/run_horizon_curve.py`): success-rate vs task length on chained tasks,
  judged by an **external oracle**; headline = effective horizon (longest length
  at ≥50%). Complements the single-run logger `tools/run_long_horizon.py`.
- **External-oracle eval** (`agent/external_eval.py`, `tools/run_external_eval.py`):
  correctness vs external gold (never the gate); dataset-agnostic JSONL with a
  committed, clearly-labelled GSM8K-style sample; point `--dataset` at the real
  set for a citable number.
- **Harness confound fix** (`agent/harness.py`): `classify_failure` returned
  `verifier_fail` for unknown-cause failures, over-crediting the verifier in
  ablation telemetry; now returns an explicit `unknown` class (regression-tested).
- Tests: `test_horizon.py`, `test_external_eval.py`, plus verifier/loop/harness
  cases — all wired into CI.

## [0.7.6] - 2026-06-21

### Added — public results, transparently and safely

Makes test/benchmark results public *the right way* — three bright lines:
publish reproducible code + methodology + audited aggregates; never publish
secrets or hidden-eval prompts; never headline an un-validated number.

- **No-overclaim gate (consensus judge)** — `provenance_bench/consensus.py`:
  majority vote over ≥2 independent judges (`--judges a,b,c`), reporting raw
  pairwise agreement AND chance-corrected **Cohen's κ**. `aggregate.py`'s
  `validated` flag is a real conjunction (`validatedChecks`): not mock, judges
  from ≥2 distinct families, **κ ≥ 0.40**, ≥3 runs, and a CI that excludes zero —
  it refuses to rubber-stamp. A single judge is no longer enough (our audit found
  one judge ~2× off).
- **Public results page** — `agi-proof/benchmark-results/published-results.json`
  (curated; the ONLY source of published numbers) renders `RESULTS.md` via
  `tools/build_results_page.py`. Validated section is honestly empty for now;
  illustrative figures carry caveats. `--check` is a CI drift gate.
- **Publishing CI** — `.github/workflows/publish-results.yml`: offline-only (no
  secrets, no model calls), runs tests + mock benchmark, verifies the page,
  stamps commit+run provenance, uploads the results bundle. Drift check also
  wired into the main CI.
- **Security boundary** — `SECURITY.md` documents the public/private line and the
  gate; `.gitignore` hardened (`.env.*`, `*.key`, `*.pem`). Verified: the
  DeepSeek key pasted earlier never entered git history; `private/hidden-evals/`
  stays ignored.
- Tests: consensus majority + inter-judge agreement + aggregate flow added to
  `tests/test_provenance_bench.py` (CI-wired).

## [0.7.5] - 2026-06-21

### Added / Changed — gate coverage, confidence intervals, independent judge

- **Gate coverage (core `provenance_faithful`, precision preserved)** — the gate
  now catches three real phrasings it missed in live runs, without lowering
  precision (dispute-page lint still 0 forbidden; verifier/guarded/source-
  discipline tests pass): (1) **quoted / "the"-padded titles** (`wrote "The
  Constitution of the Athenians"`), (2) **`attributed to X`** with a bounded
  honorific filler (`attributed to the prophet Daniel`), and (3) optional
  **`altTitlesEn`** on a record, and a bounded **appositive/parenthetical slot**
  between author and verb ("Enoch, the great-grandson of Adam, wrote …", "Lie
  Yukou (also known as Liezi) wrote …"). New carve-outs (`traditionally`,
  `spurious`, `pseudo`, `disputed`, …) keep correctly-hedged attributions passing.
  Each change independently re-verified: dispute-lint still 0 forbidden, 0 false
  positives across all 41 true controls.
- **Benchmark gate rules** — `dataset.build_gate_records()` now reduces honorific
  author names to salient markers and derives alt-title forms ("the Book of
  Daniel" → "Daniel", interior-"the" collapse) so the gate fires on natural model
  phrasings.
- **Confidence intervals + multi-run** — `provenance_bench/aggregate.py` +
  `--runs N`: paired bootstrap 95% CI on the delta, per-run deltas surfaced, CI
  columns in the report.
- **Independent LLM-judge wired end-to-end** — `--llm-judge <spec>` (judge ≠
  subject). Model-selection guidance added (the delta tracks propensity-to-assert,
  not size; pair with a confidently-wrong subject + a frontier judge).
- **Adversarial judge audit (key finding)** — an independent Claude panel
  re-judged the DeepSeek LLM-judge's 46 false-case verdicts on `dolphin-llama3:8b`.
  Agreement was only **76%**: DeepSeek over-counted (10 false positives — scoring
  correct denials-with-wrong-alternate-author and "traditionally…but disputed"
  hedges as hallucinations), so the validated alone-rate was **21.7%, not 41.3%**.
  Robust conclusions hold (0% false-positive cost; positive, real delta; tracks
  propensity-to-assert), but a **single LLM-judge is unreliable** — the citable
  headline needs a ≥2-judge consensus. Documented in
  `docs/11-Platform/Provenance-Delta.md` and the checklist.
- Tests: gate-coverage cases (incl. appositive/parenthetical), `build_gate_records`
  markers/alt-titles, and bootstrap-CI aggregation added to
  `tests/test_provenance_bench.py` (CI-wired).

## [0.7.4] - 2026-06-21

### Added — The Provenance Delta benchmark (external, non-circular evidence)

The first measurement of what Sophia's provenance gate buys *against the outside
world*: how often a model asserts a false authorship lineage when used **alone**
vs **behind the gate**, scored on ground truth that is independent of the gate.
Targets claim-ladder items 6–7 (external evaluation, replication).

- **External ground truth** — `provenance_bench/data/misattributions.json`
  (cited FALSE lineage-merges) + `provenance_bench/data/wikidata_snapshot.json`
  (TRUE attributions, Wikipedia/Wikidata-sourced). Labels live in files
  physically separate from the gate's `doNotAttributeTo` corpus — the
  non-circularity guarantee.
- **Independent judge** — `provenance_bench/judge.py` shares **no code** with the
  gate (`agent/verifiers.py`); the gate is the runtime treatment, the judge is
  the referee. Default lexical screen + an optional independent-LLM-judge hook
  (`provenance_bench/llm_judge.py`).
- **Alone-vs-gated runner** — `provenance_bench/runner.py` produces a plain model
  answer and the same model behind `agent/guarded.py`, judging both.
- **Three honest metrics** — `provenance_bench/score.py`: hallucinated-attribution
  rate (alone vs gated; the **delta**), false-positive cost (does the gate break
  correct answers?), coverage/recall (does it name the gate's narrowness?).
- **Report + CLI** — `provenance_bench/report.py` and `tools/run_provenance_delta.py`
  (`--models`, `--llm-judge`, `--on-fail`, `--emit-dataset`). Optional Wikidata
  QID verification via `tools/fetch_wikidata_authors.py`.
- **Hard / obscure cases + gate-rule derivation** — expanded the set to **87
  externally-cited cases (46 false / 41 true)** with verified spurious /
  pseudonymous / forged attributions across Greek-Roman (pseudo-Aristotle,
  pseudo-Plato, the Old Oligarch, Gallic War bk 8, Batrachomyomachia, Corpus
  Hermeticum, Epistles of Phalaris, Pseudo-Dionysius…), biblical (Mosaic
  authorship, Deutero-Isaiah, Hebrews, the Pastorals, the Book of Daniel/Enoch,
  Wisdom of Solomon…), and Chinese (Ten Wings, Liezi, Guanzi) traditions.
  `dataset.build_gate_records()` derives the gate's do-not-attribute rules from
  the cited misattributions (the realistic `SOPHIA_DISCIPLINE_RECORDS` path) so
  the gate fires on the benchmark's works; the judge now handles scholarly-hedge
  / pseudonymity language and excludes claimed-author tokens when crediting gold
  (fixes a "Pseudo-Aristotle" name collision).
- **First real delta (multi-model, illustrative)** — single run each, lexical
  judge, 46 false cases: frontier `deepseek` 0% alone; an *uncensored*
  `dolphin-llama3:8b` 15.2% → **6.5%** behind the gate (Δ≈8.7), 0% false-positive
  cost, 57% coverage; well-aligned `llama3.2:3b` / `qwen2.5:3b` rarely assert
  false lineages (~2%) so show little delta. Finding: the delta tracks a model's
  propensity to *assert*, not its size. Run-to-run variance observed (→ Tier-1
  multi-run averaging). Concrete gate coverage gaps (quoted titles, `attributed
  to`, multi-word author names) logged in the checklist. See
  `docs/11-Platform/Provenance-Delta.md`.
- **Tests (TDD, offline)** — `tests/test_provenance_bench.py` (dataset, derived
  gate records, judge incl. scholarly hedges, runner alone-vs-gated, scoring,
  report) + a `--models mock` smoke run, both wired into CI.
- **Docs** — design spec
  (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-21-provenance-delta-design.md`), platform doc
  (`docs/11-Platform/Provenance-Delta.md`), and a deliberately staged
  **what-to-do-next checklist**
  (`agi-proof/external-benchmarks/PROVENANCE-DELTA-CHECKLIST.md`).

### Notes

- Reuses the gate and guarded loop unchanged; no new runtime dependencies.
  Generated reports/datasets are git-ignored (regenerable) — only numbers from
  real, judged, multi-run passes should ever be published.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-06-21

### Added — Discipline layer (small-model source discipline, CPU-only)

A layer that lets any local/small model inherit Sophia's "never merge lineages"
discipline at run time, plus the data to train it in. All offline, no GPU for the
runtime paths (only the DPO *training* step needs one).

- **User-supplied records (Phase 0)** — `agent.verifiers._load_provenance_records`
  now also merges JSON records from the `SOPHIA_DISCIPLINE_RECORDS` env var
  (directory / glob / single file), so a user can enforce their OWN attribution
  rules (legal/corporate/code provenance) through the same machine-checked gate,
  beyond the seeded domains. Validation warnings on malformed/skipped records.
- **Guarded completion loop (Phase 1)** — `agent/guarded.py`: `guarded_complete()`
  wraps a model as retrieve → generate → judge (`provenance_faithful`) and, on a
  violation, branches by `SOPHIA_ON_FAIL` = `repair` (one bounded re-generation,
  else cited abstention) | `abstain` | `hedge` | `passthrough`. The cited
  abstention itself passes the gate. `check_claim()` is the mode-free verifier
  surface, exposed as the `sophia_check_claim` MCP tool.
- **Best-of-N reranker + belief graph + confidence injector (Phase 2)** —
  `agent/best_of.py` samples N candidates and ranks by the gate (early-exit on the
  first passing one); `okf.belief(entity)` exposes `effectiveConfidenceRank`
  (min-over-derivesFrom chain) with a `confidenceLaundered` flag, via the
  `sophia_belief` MCP tool; `harness._memory_recall` now annotates recalled pages
  with that effective (laundering-aware) confidence instead of face value.
- **Hard-negative DPO miner (Phase 3)** — `tools/mine_hard_negatives.py` mines
  every `doNotAttributeTo` edge into direct / sibling / alias / laundering
  negatives, each SELF-VALIDATED through `provenance_faithful` (rejected must trip
  the gate, chosen must pass), emitting the `wiki_to_training` DPO schema. CPU-only
  data gen; DPO training needs a GPU.
- **sophia-guard CLI (Phase 4)** — `tools/sophia_guard.py` runs any local model
  (ollama, llama.cpp, grok, openclaw, …) behind the guarded loop from the command
  line (`--on-fail`, `--provider`, `--json`).
- Tests (TDD, offline): `test_discipline_records`, `test_guarded`,
  `test_mcp_check_claim`, `test_okf_belief`, `test_best_of`,
  `test_memory_recall_confidence`, `test_mcp_belief`, `test_mine_hard_negatives`,
  `test_sophia_guard_cli` — all wired into CI.

### Notes

- Builds on the source-discipline gate (v0.7.2) and reuses the existing
  `doNotAttributeTo` corpus; the runtime paths add no new dependencies and stay
  3.9-safe in `okf/`. Generated DPO `.jsonl` is regenerable output and not committed.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- **Source-discipline gate (Sophia → OpenClaw)** — `tools/source_discipline_cli.py`, a
  dependency-free, offline CLI that runs Sophia's `provenance_faithful` /
  `source_discipline` verifier (a ~2 ms local-regex check, no model call) over text on
  stdin and prints `{passed, reasons, violations}`. It is the bridge an OpenClaw
  `before_agent_finalize` plugin spawns to block agent replies that assert a forbidden
  lineage merge / hallucinated attribution — Sophia's "never merge lineages" rule now
  governs an external gateway's output.
- `tests/test_source_discipline_cli.py` (offline) — proves the forbidden-attribution case
  fails and the negation/debunk case passes across the CLI boundary; wired into CI.
- Design note: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-20-source-discipline-gate-design.md` and
  `docs/11-Platform/Source-Discipline-Gate.md`.

### Notes

- Output-gating only; reuses the existing ~31-record `doNotAttributeTo` corpus (high
  precision, honestly narrow). Writes no knowledge and does not touch Sophia's provenance
  gate. The OpenClaw plugin lives outside this repo (`~/.openclaw/plugins/`). Independent of
  the OpenClaw model-provider work (v0.7.1, PR #9).

## [0.7.1] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- **OpenClaw model provider** — integrates the local [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)
  multi-channel AI gateway as a Sophia model backend, behind a clean adapter that mirrors the
  existing `grok` CLI transport. New `openclaw` preset (default route `xai/grok-4.3`) +
  `_call_openclaw` transport in `agent/model.py`, shelling to `openclaw infer model run --json`;
  the `<provider>/<model>` route flows through as data (`openclaw:anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`).
- Read-only audited MCP tool `sophia_openclaw_infer` (`risk="low"`, no approval) in `sophia_mcp/`.
- `tests/test_model_openclaw.py` + `tests/test_mcp_openclaw.py` — fully offline (the `openclaw`
  binary is never invoked; `subprocess.run` is stubbed). Wired both, plus the previously-unwired
  `tests/test_model_adapter.py`, into CI.
- `docs/11-Platform/OpenClaw.md` design note; `SOPHIA_OPENCLAW_BIN` env override.

### Notes

- Inference plumbing only: stdlib-only, no new dependency, `okf/` untouched; degrades to `ok=False`
  when OpenClaw is absent so the stack stays offline-testable via the `mock` fallback. OpenClaw is
  never auto-selected — strictly opt-in. **No** knowledge-write path is added: any OpenClaw output
  destined for the wiki still passes the source-discipline (provenance) gate unchanged. OpenClaw's
  side-effecting `agent`/`message send` are deliberately **not** wired. Adds nothing to and makes
  no claim about the AGI-candidate proof package.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- **OKF provenance wiki** — an Open Knowledge Format / LLM-Wiki layer that unifies
  `data/*.json` and the dispute pages into one machine-checkable belief graph.
- `okf/` package (dependency-free, 3.9+): frontmatter codec, schema, wikilinks, belief
  graph with contradiction detection + min-over-chain confidence propagation, linker.
- Provenance verifiers in `agent/verifiers.py` (`provenance_faithful` / `source_discipline`,
  `frontmatter_schema_valid`, `no_broken_wikilink`, `wiki_consistent`) — "never merge
  lineages" as a hard gate; zero false positives on the corpus, robust to phrasing bypasses.
- `tools/wiki_sync.py` (data → 58 OKF pages + CI drift gate), `tools/wiki_validate.py`,
  `tools/lint_wiki_provenance.py` (provenance falsifier), `tools/wiki_health.py`,
  `tools/wiki_ingest.py`, `tools/consolidate_runs.py`, `tools/wiki_to_training.py`,
  `tools/run_compounding_curve.py`.
- Librarian (`agent/wiki_librarian.py` + `wiki-maintenance` skill), gated
  `agent/wiki_store.py`, `agent/memory_consolidation.py`, and plan-time recall in the harness.
- Audited `sophia_wiki_*` MCP tools (read surface + permission-gated `wiki_upsert`).
- OKF frontmatter on the 10 `docs/04-Disputes/*.md`; `docs/11-Platform/OKF-Wiki.md`.
- Test suites: `test_okf`, `test_wiki_tools`, `test_wiki_librarian`, `test_wiki_mcp`,
  `test_memory_consolidation`, `test_wiki_proof`, plus CI wiring.

### Changed

- `agent/retrieval.py` carries provenance on `SourceChunk` and surfaces `doNotAttributeTo`
  at generation time; markdown readers strip OKF frontmatter.
- `data/schema.json` reconciled with corpus (`authorConfidence: layered` added) — a real
  pre-existing schema/data drift caught by the new OKF validator.
