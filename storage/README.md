# Sophia storage — `kvcache` (Phase 1)

A sharded, async, in-memory **KV cache** in Rust, and the Python seam that lets
Sophia's RAG path offload hot reads to it. This is Phase 1 of the
[distributed-storage roadmap](../docs/storage/STORAGE_ROADMAP.md) — the first
concrete artifact mapping the repo toward the high-performance-storage skill set
(Rust, async, multithreading, latency engineering).

> **Honest scope.** Single node, in-memory only, request/response (no
> pipelining), no persistence, no replication. It is a *cache*, not a database —
> losing it costs latency, never correctness. Persistence (io_uring on-disk
> engine) and replication (Raft) are Phases 2–3, deliberately not faked here.

## Architecture

```

 client ───►│  accept loop ──► one async task per connection                          │

            │             intrusive doubly-linked-list LRU + slab                     │
            └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────-─┘
```

- **Sharding** (`cache.rs`) — keys hash (FNV-1a, deterministic across processes)
  to one of N independent shards, each an `Lru` behind its own `std::sync::Mutex`.
  Lock contention scales as ~1/N; the lock is never held across `.await`.
- **LRU with TTL** (`lru.rs`) — O(1) get/insert/evict via a slab + intrusive
  doubly-linked list; no scan to find the victim. TTLs expire lazily on access.
- **Wire protocol** (`protocol.rs`) — length-prefixed, big-endian, binary-safe
  (keys/values may contain any bytes). Ops: GET, SET (with TTL), DEL, PING, STATS.
- **Server** (`server.rs`) — Tokio, one task per connection, `TCP_NODELAY`,
  buffered reader/writer. Concurrency comes from many connections.

## Build, test, run

```bash
cd storage
cargo test                 # 13 unit + 5 integration tests, all offline
cargo clippy --all-targets # clean
cargo run --release --bin kvcache-server -- --addr 127.0.0.1:7070 --shards 16 --capacity 1000000
```

## Benchmark

`kvcache-bench` spawns the real server on an ephemeral port and drives concurrent
clients over loopback TCP — it measures the **full** client→TCP→server→client
round trip, not just the in-memory map.

```bash
cargo run --release --bin kvcache-bench -- --clients 32 --ops 30000 --keys 100000
```

Representative run (32 clients × 30k GETs, 100k keys, 256-byte values, 16 shards;
loopback, results vary by host — these are from CI-class hardware, recorded in
[../RESULTS.md](../RESULTS.md)):

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| throughput | ~195k ops/sec |
| latency p50 | ~161 µs |
| latency p99 | ~282 µs |
| latency p99.9 | ~374 µs |

The headline limiter is the **one-in-flight-request-per-connection** design;
request pipelining (Phase 1b) is the next throughput lever. These numbers exist
to make later optimizations measurable, not to claim they are good yet.

## Using it from Sophia (Python)

The cache is **opt-in and fail-closed**. With `SOPHIA_KVCACHE_ADDR` unset,
nothing changes. With it set, `agent/vector_store.py:search()` caches results
keyed by the query, `top_k`, and a fingerprint of the chunk set + query
embedding; a dead cache silently degrades to a normal search.

```bash
# terminal 1
cargo run --release --bin kvcache-server -- --addr 127.0.0.1:7070
# terminal 2
export SOPHIA_KVCACHE_ADDR=127.0.0.1:7070   # that's the only switch
```

`agent/kvcache_client.py` is a dependency-free pure-Python client speaking the
same protocol; its lenient `get`/`set` never raise, the strict `*_strict`
variants do.

## What's next (see the roadmap)

- **1b** — request pipelining; value-size histograms; admission control.
- **2** — on-disk engine (`io_uring` via `tokio-uring`/`glommio`), WAL, crash
  consistency — turns the cache into a durable tier.
- **3** — Raft replication (`openraft`) across shards for a strongly-consistent
  control plane.
- **4** — specialize as an **LLM inference KVCache** (prefix-keyed blocks,
  RAM→SSD tiering) — the role's core responsibility.
